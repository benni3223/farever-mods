# Combat presentation and native Barbershop

Checked against the supplied October 1 Live `hlboot.dat` (HL6), SHA-256
`617f602066c762869d5c15a01c83714664b0026868f0d24b129bbcc850da88d8`.

## Damage suppression

`ui.comp.DamageDisplay.display(DamageResult, VectorImpl)` already returns null
when the native damage-number visibility flag is false. The mod uses the same
return for its disabled-numbers option. `ent.Unit.rpcReceiveDamage__impl`
ignores this return; the damage RPC itself is not skipped. Incoming numeric
damage uses `ui.hud.EffectsFeed.displayDamage`, which only creates/stylizes a
feed row and can also be skipped. The same option now suppresses healing:
`ui.comp.HealDisplay.display(DamageResult, {x:Float,y:Float,z:Float})` already
returns null when native number visibility is disabled, and
`ent.Unit.rpcDisplayHeal__impl` ignores the returned display. The mod returns
null through the same presentation boundary. Received/self healing uses
`ui.hud.EffectsFeed.displayHeal(DamageResult):Void`, which only creates/styles
a feed row and is skipped separately. Its fancy-styling postfix also checks
the hiding option because HLX still runs postfixes after a skipped call; it
must not restyle a previous healing row. Combat notifications and actual healing
continue normally. Both new targets are callable (static display companion and
instance displayHeal prototype), and their native signatures are preserved.

## Allied minion bars

Overhead `ui.hud.FoeWidget` contains `ui.hud.FoeCombatInfo.healthBar`, an
instance of `ui.comp.HealthBar`. Filtering only that component keeps other
widget indicators intact. Classification requires an `ent.Foe` with a
`summonOwner`, the local hero's layer, and native `isEnemy(hero) == false`. The local hero's own summons are excluded.
Player/party bars and health bars outside an overhead FoeWidget are excluded.

The refresh callback belongs to the parent widget, which remains active when
its health component is hidden. The visibility hook remembers later native
visibility requests so disabling the setting restores the intended state.
Ownership/hostility refresh is capped at five checks per second per bar, and
disabled, unfiltered bars return without native lookups.

## Appearance entry point

`ui.win.GearAppearance.init()` provides `scene`, `unit`, and an array of
`ui.win.AppearanceSlot` buttons. `scene.parent` is the native character panel;
the `Slot_Hands` button confirms the native slot layout is ready. The top and right insets are both 15 native UI units. Horizontal placement uses the panel and button's calculated widths so it follows the panel edge on resize. The vertical inset matches `character .content.character #appearanceModeBtn`'s native `offset-y: -15` bottom positioning from the supplied resource stylesheet. The new DOMKit button uses
panel-relative bounds and absolute positioning, without modifying the model
viewport or adding ImGui. Only the local hero's page gets a button. Its action
requests the existing editor on the next game update, outside UI dispatch.
Rebuilt/removed pages invalidate old button actions.

`CombatUiTest` exercises production visibility and button code with native
adapters in both the interpreter and HashLink. It covers visibility restoration,
hostility/ownership changes, excluded bars, local-player checks, layout changes,
page replacement, and stale actions. Native mod compilation also passes.
Actual button rendering and multiplayer minion presentation need in-game testing.
